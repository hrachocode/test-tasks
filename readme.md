Hello there! ðŸ˜Š

This is a test for Eiger Ltd. Feel free to approach it in whatever order works best for you.


There is 3 test tasks in this test:


The 1st can be done in any language
The 2nd must be JS with Node.js
The 3rd is an open task that requires to understand and give an explanation for a few points that a senior developer must be able to do


We'd appreciate it if you could submit your answers via the link provided in the Github project, where all the solutions are compiled.
Good luck! ðŸ˜Š

P.S. Itâ€™s best to use JS/TS as they are cored part of our stack, but any other functional language that you are skilled at is also fine for the sake of this task.
